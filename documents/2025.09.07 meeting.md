Summary

### Meeting Overview

The meeting was a brainstorming session to develop project ideas for Nanobanana, an AI image generation and manipulation tool. The team discussed various concepts that could potentially be developed for a demo or competition. After generating multiple ideas, they worked to categorize and prioritize the most promising concepts.

### Project Ideas

The team brainstormed nine main project concepts:

1. **AI Storytelling Tool** - A system that generates comics from user-provided story scripts. Features include character consistency across panels, automated storyboarding, and the ability to transform novels into visual comic formats.
2. **NanoAndy** - A tool that allows users to upload images, extract key components, modify elements (such as color, features, skin), and generate new characters or scenes. Users can then place these characters into videos with selected stories or scenes.
3. **Nano Changing Room** - A virtual try-on application where users upload selfies to visualize different hairstyles and fashion items on themselves.
4. **AI Memorial Biography Video** - Generates representative photos of life milestones based on user input, then creates a memory video chronicling the person's life journey from childhood to adulthood.
5. **What's Your Baby Looks Like** - Predicts how a baby would look based on user selfies and selected celebrity partners or potential co-parents.
6. **My Resources** - Creates future versions of users based on their career goals or aspirations, generating visual motivation of what they could become.
7. **Life Habits Prediction** - Visualizes how users might look in 5, 10, or 20 years based on their current lifestyle habits, serving as a health warning system.
8. **Health Habits Visualization Tool** - Analyzes food products and ingredients to show potential health impacts over time.
9. **Billboard/Famous Location Integration** - Places users into famous billboards or landmark locations for shareable content.

### Technical Discussions

The team discussed several technical aspects of the Nanobanana platform:

-   Current issues with Mule Logging feature having a low success rate
-   Challenges with consistency in AI-generated content
-   The importance of having well-defined workflows for demonstrations
-   The need for storyboards to improve content flow
-   Cross-platform compatibility considerations (iOS, Android, web)

### Action Items

-   [ ] Fix bugs with the Mule Logging feature's save functionality
-   [ ] Address the "retry" functionality issue
-   [ ] Add amount functionality to the application
-   [ ] Fix UX problems with the login screen
-   [ ] Finalize categorization of project ideas into 3-4 main submissions
-   [ ] Continue development on Friend and Challenge features
-   [ ] Prepare a demo video (approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute in length)
-   [ ] Review embedded Figma designs for feature implementation

Notes

Transcript

I am recording the meeting now. Recording now. We are recording the meeting now.

What do you think? Do you think we should just release the current UI, or should we reframe it first? Let's talk about beta. I think we should go straight to beta. I mean, reframe beta. We need to finish the challenge first. Ok, ok, ok. Let's continue developing. Let's continue to develop according to the work. Let's continue to develop in the last week. Ok, ok. Otherwise, UX will be left behind. Ok, ok, ok. Let's do it in the last two days.

We can do a challenge in the next 4-5 hours and give it to our fans. Because we need accountability. We don't have accountability. I understand. I don't know how to use it. I am stuck in the Mule Logging experience. I don't know if you are using the new version. I took a photo of the new version. The result will be out in about 10 seconds. I am using it in Hong Kong. I don't know if you think it will be faster.

It's a bit slow. The problem is that the success rate is a bit low. I need to debug it. Because sometimes when I take photos, it doesn't save the record. I think there should be some iOS code. I will fix this later. There are some problems with the experience.

Pass. Give me note.

Can you see it, sir? Yes, I can see it. So... This edit is not done yet. I can follow it. Let me see... High-priority division of labor. It should be this one. Let me turn up the volume. Is it too loud?

Let me take a look. Yes, I need to do this. There is a bug here. Fail to save new...

Let's clean this up first. Aren't you supposed to be drinking coffee at 2am? I'm so sleepy, I can't sleep. What? Drinking coffee at 2am? I don't recommend it. See you in a bit. Oh shit.

Let me write down the related mail logging. This one, there are some bugs. The success rate is a bit low. Anyway, it is not every time that I can successfully save the mail log. The second one is add the amount. I can edit this one later. The third one is the U.S.

address. The card is hard to send. This one is not urgent. This one is low priority. I have already assigned this feature to you. Let's see if you can see it. Oh, I haven't assigned it to you yet. Let me assign it to you first. I have already assigned this feature design to you. You can refer to Figma. I have embedded Figma's link in this ticket.

I have also texted you once. You can research on how to design the system. I think Sheldon's presentation last time was quite good. His idea and design. It's quite interesting. You can refer to it and see how it's designed. I'll share this with myself. This is for us to share the pork.

This box is for tasks. US Improvement for Food Friend Tab. This is also for you. You can choose what you want to do. Friend Love Skin. This is a friend activity screen. You can choose what you want. I will leave it to you. You can design your own friend and challenge.

I mainly follow the mail logging method. Let's take a look at the task in Kanbanbot. Oh, this one is done. The VPN task is done. If you don't want to use VPN, you can still save Mule. AI analysis, retry. I haven't done this yet. I can get it back. I'll get it back. You can focus on Friend and Challenge. Retry, I'll fix it. Fail to save new Mule log, I'll fix it. It's not 100% success rate now.

Add-in amount, I'll fix it. UX problem. Log-in screen shouldn't pop up. These two are lower. Improved Potion Calibration Is this a toggle switch? Is this a slider?

I will add it to my description.

This is also from you, Challenge. What is this? Research on Alpha?

If you go to this link, you should be able to see my voice memo. You should be able to see that MyTasks has its own tasks. Let's see if there are any. So what is MyTasks? Let's see if there are any. You should be able to see Friend and... 我幫你加 filter。

What did you say? You let him continue talking. Okay, I will stop talking for a while. I will continue to record the current situation for you. You continue to analyze. Why is there a fire?

Okay, I'm going to continue. Actually, this tool will come to life. I think it's because it reduces the possibility for ordinary people to enter 3D models. It can be compared with Sichuan. Oh, it's like a reference to Hong Kong. It's like an unofficial comment.

It's a 3D effect with a sense of reality. This editing makes people feel interesting and attractive. And on social media, this kind of tool that allows people to play, display, and share is particularly easy to cause viral spread. In short, it's because it turns many high-cost and professional things into something simple and interesting, so people naturally want to try and discuss it.

This is the 7GB analysis. I will open a new track. I will open a new track. Okay.

You just need to log in and press the join button. It's best to log in from a non-HK account. You should be able to locate it then.

Okay, I will continue to record it for you. Anyway, I will record what you are discussing now. You can ask me again if you need anything.

Hi, S-Phoenix. I call over.

I will continue to record your conversation. Let me know if you need anything. Is this from Google?

This is a voice memo. It has been edited to include proper punctuation.

Is there anyone who has changed the name to LaluBanana.ai? It's all Google Official. Oh, yes. That's right. These are... What are they called? A kind of business model. Yes, that's right. It's a business model.

Look at it. Have you captured it? Look at the rules first. I searched for Korea. I can't find it. Located in a country where parts cannot be removed.

I know what you're talking about. Where does it say?

Complaint about eligibility.

I didn't write it properly, did I? Oh, I did. Did we get sanctioned? I think so. It's not official. Let's see. It's a friend. Yes, it is! March 31st. There it is! Sentence Programme and Punctuation Information Oh... Hong Kong Veteran Sentence

Okay, I will continue to write these down. If there is anything else you need to add, feel free to let me know. No worries, I have a...

Okay, I will keep it that way. But you can only edit the product. You can only edit the photo, not the video. You can't use VOP. Anyway, the main point is that the demo video has to be good enough. Because I saw that, just now, Apple also said that people will cut a few pictures, use a printer to cut a few pictures, and then give it to WillField to throw the story out.

Humanity is a feature. The first thing that comes to mind when I think of humanity is a novel. So that's your idea? Yes.

I think the concept is the most classic and everyone will think of this way. I like this kind of concept.

Okay, I have already recorded the discussion for you. If you have any new ideas or anything to add, feel free to let me know. I will continue recording.

Some people like to use Marvel, Superman, or certain characters.

Is it okay? Do you think it sounds like you or someone else? I can't hear you. You can't hear me? Come here, sit here. For example, you can change the clothes on top. The next part is to put the two characters into a scene or a story. And then he will put these two characters into a video. There will be a mix-and-match to create new videos.

I've seen this before, but it's not the problem. It's about changing the famous movie's scenario, the scenes, and the people in it. The background concept is a defect, but with a superb consistency.

Okay, that's it. But... You keep talking. You keep talking, you shut up. Sorry, you keep talking. Pan Chu Sing, shut up. There will be a group of people behind the camera. Then you just have to be gentle. You just have to be very simple and fast. We will have a video of the campaign. Then you can feed your photo.

We first used Germany's Gerlano Bonanna to generate the starting theme. It's similar to the YouTube video we just made. Then we asked VOV to fill up the screen at the back, and so on. Do you understand my concept? Is it the same as your idea? Yes, it's similar. It will have images and videos.

It is a use case when you want to use a scene from a movie. But if you want to use a scene from a YouTuber, or if you want to hire a celebrity to shoot an ad, you don't need the person to present the scene. You just need to take their photo, and that's it.

This is a use case. This is a bad idea. This is a good idea. Someone started to use it. It's called Optimate Creative Workflow. Now you don't need to have a model. You have a model, add a plot, and you can generate a workflow. The concept is that you upload two or three photos to extract the component. What is this? It's called... You've seen the virtual check-on before? Yes. Super-authority to buy a new platform.

It's a copyrighted platform. You can upload your personal information, voice and appearance to a marketplace, and people can rent your stuff for use cases. If you don't approve it, you have to let them do it. If you accept it, they'll pay you. You can sell your stuff for $10.

Have you seen this tool recently? I remember you showed it to me a long time ago. About a year or two ago. It was released by Google Labs. Do you remember that a while ago, a lot of people liked to add something like the Tokyo Tower to the real world?

Have you seen it? Yes, I have. I haven't seen it. Actually, the concept you just mentioned is Reliance and Verge. It's a realistic reality concept. At that time, I tried it out and generated a bunch of... At that time, I think Sing's Sheldon generated this picture. It's a frozen hippo. I don't remember. I don't know how old you are. I remember, I remember. Once I imported it...

I have an impression of this yellow one. I thought it was an imported cat, but it was sent to AmiList. I wanted to do AmiList, so I did this. You just have to animate it. Watching. A lost animal. A lost relative. If we just focus on Agathon, how do we get viral?

I just gave him the competition requirements and tools. He gave us some high winning topics. You can take a look at my screen. See? Recommended High Potential Domain Topics. The first one is Storytelling and Entertainment. AI Comic Generator, which is the same character across 10 panels. I don't know why.

The first one is A.I. Children's Bookmaker, a music video with frame-consistent visuals, MV. The second one is Virtual Try-On, Eco-Models. They are all related to fashion, so I won't go into details. Fashion design, living room furniture, are all good ideas. The third one is education and learning.

History Visualizer. I've never thought of this. It's quite interesting. It looks like Sing's concept, but the backbone is... Visualize something you can't see before. This is really interesting. It's a science comic. I saw that a while ago, there was a person who liked to visualize nerves with memes. Visualize.

And yet you all stay in Egypt. So it's a meme. Meme generator. Professional creativity tools. Marketing Content Generator, aka WIKI.AI Flamesway Bot Generation AI Flare Retoucher These are the ideas provided by the AI.

Let's do one for each of us. We don't have to do one for each of us. Sing's is storytelling. Andy's is marketing. I don't know how to continue with the video. I mean the virtual try-on. It's actually low-code now. As long as we can come up with an idea. We've been using Chatterjee to come up with an idea. Everyone can go to the AI Studio build and paste it in. No need for knowledge.

I think it's worth mentioning the AI comic. I'll write down the notes for the AI comic.

Where's my Nox?

Hey, MacBook, you're not being very nice to me.

Okay, I will write down all the ideas of the AI comic you just mentioned. If there are any other points or ideas, I will continue to record them for you. First of all, can you tell us more about the demo of the AI comic? What elements will it have? What will it look like?

I think the most important thing is to show its consistency. It's best to have a basis of about 10 characters. Their name, actions, and dialogue.

We will have to fine-tune the script and the nanobanana to make it more high-quality. So what do you want to include in the input? A novel or what? I think... Are the prompts in Chinese or in English? The prompts are in Chinese. Or you can choose a topic, and it will give you a list of topics. For example, you can choose a Chinese-style topic or a Marvel-style topic.

But the output is comic, right? Yes. The output is comic, but the input, the storyboard, do you want to use the real thing? Or do you want the creators to use it? So it's not a little bit of extra work. After thinking about it, it will come out slowly.

So it's not a novel turning into a comic book? I think it's a novel turning into a comic book. But if I don't know how to do a demo, if I just copy the novel, will it work? It's a bit strange. If I copy the Chinese script, it will be like this. Okay, so this is the story input script. It's like a story script. The user creates the story script, and then writes the comic through Internet of Things. Okay, this is the first project.

Remember, it's an AI comic. Do you have any ideas? I want to share. Okay. I know. I have written down what I want to say in Notion. What did you say? You said you wanted to film a drama, right? No, I meant you can... Give me a name. Second project.

I haven't thought of a name yet. You can call it AIG. The second project is called NanoAndy. What does NanoAndy do? At the beginning, you can... You can upload different images and extract the key components from the images. For the extracted components, you can add some add-ons, such as skin, color, or features to create a new character.

Or a character that you have imagined. Then you can generate a video for these characters. You can choose a story or a scene for the video. Then you can generate a video.

Okay, I have already recorded your project called NanoAndy. Basically, it is to upload some images first, extract the key elements inside, and then add some unique features. Change the color or feature, create a new grid color, and then upload the video with the story or scene you choose.

I will record this process and idea. What is the demo of NanoAndy? The demo is a tool that allows you to upload an image Then you can extract the character or product image from the image Then you can modify the components on top Then you can type a prompt to generate the image

For example, a character holding a product shot, or a character in a specific scene. Then you can generate the entire storytelling. After entering all the points, you can generate the video. I want to ask 7GBT, how did he come up with this idea, the nano-ending project, to make a demo that is the best wild factor, and the best impression for the audience?

Of course. Let me help you with the punctuation. In fact, for the demo of the Nano Andy project, you need to find the best wall factor. The key is to let the audience see the experience of the whole process and the consistency of the final result. You can design a demo like this.

First, show a very ordinary daily photo, maybe a face-to-face photo of a person, or a simple product photo. Then show how to use the function of Nano Banana to extract the elements in these photos For example, you can change the costume of a superhero for the character. Or you can add some fantasy backgrounds to the product. Next, you can show the audience how to create a complete short film or comic page in a matter of seconds or tens of seconds.

The characters in these pages are consistent with the original creation, but at the same time, there is a whole new scene and narrative. Finally, show this tool how to make the user easy to get started. Entering a simple prompt can produce interesting and consistent content.

In this way, the audience can leave a deep impression on the prosperity and creativity of this project.

Ok, it's a bit out of tune. Let's continue with the next one.

I came up with an idea. I wrote a project about trying on and changing clothes. The third project is called Nano Changing Room. This project requires users to submit their own selfie photos. Then, through Nano Banana, they can try on different hairstyles.

They can create multiple photos. Users can see what they would look like if they changed their hairstyle.

Okay, I understand. I have already recorded the concept of your third project, Nano Changing Room. The main purpose of this project is to let users upload selfies, and then use Nano Banana to help them wear different hairstyles, or fashionably wear a bandage, and automatically upload multiple photos of different bandages, so that users can intuitively see what kind of bandage suits them.

This kind of demo is also quite attractive.

We have three projects.

Okay, now we have three ideas. If there is anything else you want to add or continue to discuss, just let me know. Alpha M, Alpha. Mine is the third one. Yes, yours is the third one. I want to add something. I want to add something about the first AI comic.

I know there's an AI story studio. You can look at my screen. I really don't know. I don't have a computer. You look like a painter. I see, I see. I've never heard you talk about this. You are Civil War 4. You can talk about GenVideos or GenComics. I should have helped you sell these things. I should have helped you sell these things. You are such a waste. I should have helped you sell these things.

I'm Tom and Jerry.

The language is fantasy and cyberpunk.

The initial plot idea is an all-man Jerry story, but in a cyber world. Tom is a cat, Jerry is a mouse. The cat. And there is a rat. To help. Stay strong. I was just talking about Sing's story. The script for the story is usually very difficult for people to generate and write. It's very slow.

I made an AI Story Studio with my friend before. You can set up a bunch of characters' titles, languages, scrims, and initial plot ideas. I don't know if it's because it's too old, or because it's too slow. Anyway, the process will be formulated one by one. Foundation, idea, outline, manage, etc.

Once you have all these things, you can generate a story with Fold or MuteView.

The spark of idea. Tom, a genetically modified cat, a man with cyber-sympathetic something. You can see it now. In a cyberpunk dystopia, save and continue to manage it. I'll turn it over to Howard and then we'll go.

You only need to reference the image you really want it to reference. The bullet level is non-human. If you want to go to Andorra, you have to go there.

This is the story script for January.

Actually, all the ideas are from all over the world. It depends on how we assemble them. What about Precious? No, no, no, I mean the real Precious. The real Precious? Precious. Oh, Precious. P-R-E-C-I-O-U-S. Is this right? Precious. Okay.

Precious. Okay, sorry. I just thought of something. Do you remember this demo? That's about it. Nenobanana creates a picture of each of your milestones. And then uses Reel3 to... As you grow older, each of your milestones will be different. For example, you graduated from primary school, middle school, or university, or your first job, etc. The growth video of your wedding.

Yes, the growth video of your wedding. Nenobanana creates a picture of each of your milestones, and then uploads it to Reel3. At the end, it creates a video about how you have changed since you were young. It is a kind of growth record to view your precious moments.

You can use it yourself. You can use it yourself and be happy. You can use it yourself and be happy.

This is the summary of the 4th project.

Okay, I will briefly summarize the concept of the fourth project. This project is called AI Memorial Biography Video. It allows users to input their personal information, such as the year of birth, location, and important milestone in life. Then use Nanobanana to generate representative photos of a certain stage in life.

Then use Vio or similar tools to link these photos together to generate a memory video that records the precious moments of each user from childhood to adulthood. This way, users can intuitively see every important moment in their lives being re-enacted by AI into a special ghost story film. And this idea can be applied to pets. Everyone knows how sad it is to have a pet.

I'm concerned that it has a lot of content to set up. If you want to demo an app, you need people to engage viral and share it to themselves. Unless you're Google Photos and you can automate it. Oh... Stylish on screen. Oh, sorry, that's a picture of his parents. Yeah, that's fine. Actually, he used to make a video of his parents, but there was an ethical issue.

What kind of evocation is there? But this sentence will be popular. I've done it before. Write it down. What's your baby looks like? What's your baby looks like? Maybe you and... The most famous Korean star, Park Bo-kyem, and you have a son, what will he look like? He will definitely be famous. Ok, I will write it down. This is the 5th project. The 5th project is called What is your baby looks like? The user submitted a selfie and chose a celebrity he likes.

All reverse What? Can you say it again? I can't hear you You can hear me You can look for your dad. Look for your dad. What do you mean comfortable? I thought you were doing DNA check. Yeah, it's D.A.H. He does this kind of stuff. It's a Land of Banana version of Chum Chum. It's not too bad. Because China has the issue of kidnapping children.

I'll try to meet Gemini. Ask him. Will he give it to you? Will he give it to me? Maybe it'll be expensive.

Okay, I've already recorded the 5th project, What's Your Baby Looks Like? and some other interesting ideas. You can upload your selfies, choose a name, and say what your baby will look like. Or some interesting points to clarify. I've already recorded all of these.

If you need to add anything, just let me know. We are recording a project now. Make it 10?

We can listen to it again and pick a few more, one more per person. Anyone else? Anyone else? Anyone else? Just think. Don't think responsibly.

I'll do it for you. Let me think about it. You are a speculated foreign artist, based on the DAU. You are a speculated foreign artist, based on the DAU.

You asked me to find out how a bird looks like from the image of a person. The first part is very simple. Analyze the photo bar by bar. Hey, this really works. Let's try to run a challenge. The simplest one. Open a new track and load it.

See you in a bit.

I cannot fulfill. It's very confusing. Okay, so it will be banned. Let's try it.

Oh, that's crazy. In the US, a lot of Chinese are adopted. I don't know if it's the same for white parents. But it can still be generated. Yes, you can do it. But you want the Chinese to do this? It's a bit difficult. It's a bit difficult. It's a bit difficult to make it sound like this. I don't think I can do it.

It's done. Ah Ming, it's done. What's your baby look like? I'm trying to use what baby look like. I'm using an Android 7 for testing. What else do you want to know?

Okay, my resources. My resources. The 7th project is called My Resources. The user uploads their own selfies, and then says what kind of job they want to do, or what kind of person they want to be in the future. Through AI, Lando Balanna, he creates a role model, a person he wants to be.

It's his own face. So that when he sees what possibilities he has in the future, he will be more motivated to advance in that direction. Sleep Interest Prediction 5 years later, 10 years later 20 years later... It has become a pair of pants. ...of...現象化... Not bad, let's take a look.

Let me take a look.

Hey, these fucking Chinese people know how to steal business from factories. These fucking Chinese people are always stealing business from factories. I can't put this in Chinese. Thank you for watching!

This project is called Chum Chum.

Okay, I hear you. I will record the 7th and 8th topics for you. The 7th topic, My Support, is to let users upload their selfies, and then tell the AI what kind of person they want to be in the future, or what kind of job they want to do. Nanobanana will create a future version of the user image based on this information. Let the user visually see their future potential, so that they will be more motivated to work towards that direction. The eighth case, Chen Jin. The inspiration for this case is to use AI to predict and generate the potential appearance of all family members.

For example, using a child's photo to give a mother's photo to infer the appearance of a father. Or using your own photo and a child's photo to see what your child will look like. These interesting ideas can be used as an interesting demo to let users experience. I have already recorded it. What else do you want to tell me? The sixth project is called Sink. The fifth project is called Watch Your Baby Looks Like. The eighth project is called Life Habits, Food Habits, Prediction.

The eighth project is for users to input their daily life habits, food habits, health information, such as weight, fat ratio, appearance, what job they usually do, The voice memo contains a list of patterns that will be repeated in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and so on. The voice memo will then be projected to the user to let them know what kind of user they will be in the future. The voice memo warns the user to quit smoking, drinking, and so on.

Oh, I get it now. This is a threatening message. It's developed and can be sold to the government.

Wow, we can do this project. Based on what I just said, can you summarize the 8th project?

Okay, let me summarize the 8th project for you. The 8th project is life habits prediction. It allows users to input their daily life habits, eating habits, and some health-related knowledge, such as weight, body fat, and resting time, etc. Through nanobanana AI prediction, if they maintain these habits, what will they look like 5, 10, or 20 years later?

This kind of visual prediction allows users to realize that their current habits may have a long-term impact, and play a reminder and warning role. For example, it helps users decide whether to smoke, drink, or improve other bad habits. This way, the entire project can be shared with users, allowing them to see their own smart home, and the impact it will have on the future. I have already recorded it for you. Okay, I've thought of the 9th one. The 9th one is called...

If you use it for a long time, how will it affect your baby? Please let the user know if it is safe or not.

Okay, I got it. Let me record the 9th project for you. The 9th project is about baby food safety. This project is about taking photos of baby food for users, such as milk powder or other baby food. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. You continue to sum up the 9th project.

We can put all three of them in one screen. I've already recorded it for you. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to add. Is it possible to put past relatives in wedding photos? Yes.

I think there are 9 projects so far. The 9th project is about disposal. It is about using nano-banana to extract raw materials. Then we can visualize the raw materials to see if they are safe or not. I am sorry but you have hit the time limit for this conversation.

Please start a new chat to keep the conversation going.

Hello, we can continue the conversation. Check your GPT.

Of course. If you have anything to say, you can tell me. I'm always here to accompany you. You are now an AI meeting recorder. Unless we clearly ask you to answer questions, you will be in charge of recording our meeting.

This is the extraction function. Just like Michelle, you put the cake in and extract the ingredients. The AI analyzes the ingredients. Then it tells you if a healthy user has been using these ingredients for a month or half a year, what it looks like, to intimidate him.

To let him know if it is safe. It is similar to the 8th life habit, which is to input your life habits into the product. The 8th life habit is to tell you whether your current lifestyle is healthy. The 2nd life habit is to tell you whether this product is healthy.

Let's see how many projects we can get. The baby look and reverse baby look are interesting. Baby look and reverse baby look can be grouped into one project. It is a demo of different features. Some ideas can be features, some ideas can be projects. Some ideas can be completely different, some ideas can be categorized.

Let me help you. I just came up with a new flow. You upload a photo of yourself. First, the system will generate a photo of your dad and mom. Then it will generate a photo of the box. The next step is to generate a picture from 10 years ago. Oh, I see. This is it. This is what the mouse is for. This is what the mouse is for.

If you are human, you don't even need to imagine it. Yes, that's right. We have 9 items now. Should we add a more educational item?

Oh, I see. There's a video jam. Are there any of these tools available now? Yes, there was one released last month. You asked him to teach me a concept, it's a... It's a quantum expression. But it's too hard, it's hard to visualize. I want Mickey to be in it. Sure, go ahead. I see that people's prompts are similar to... For example, you are a musician. You might use the concept of a musician to explain some physical characteristics.

It will use a person to explain things to make it easier to understand Or people will use Picasso's style to explain quantum mechanics or finance Oh, that's the Peter from before Do you remember? That's Peter We have this plan We have this function Yes, we can use character names or characters to describe the short views. We've already planned this, but we can still... I was just about to say, imagine what we'll look like the next day after we eat something. We can actually add that to our list.

You can say it like that. You may have put your own appetite in it. You eat too much today. You will see you are fatter. Customize.

Did I mention the 10th idea? Oh, you're talking about the tutorial video. Let's see if we can do the LLM. He's working on it. He's making a video. He's working on it. He needs some time. The visualizer concept is actually in my current app. You can see it on my screen. Oh, there it is. You can see how...

You can change the punctuation after you reduce the number of words. Oh, this is really... Damn it. Real requirement. This is a real requirement. You generated my map. My map is like this.

Knowledge Graph Review. It helps us watch videos. And it can be used to drag broadcasts. Very basic.

It's a step, you know. Yes, the previous folder is 10 years old. And if you add 2 photos and 1 photo, the difference is almost double the amount of steps. If you put yourself in it, you can imagine what your parents were like 10 years ago, or bi-directional.

You can generate your parents and your potential background. The color of your photo is optional. Or you can pre-set it. Like IU, right? IU, right? IU, right? People like to put their name next to their name. Oh, the one where they hold hands. Imagination. The one where they hold hands. No, not holding hands. The one where they take selfies together. Oh, I've seen it. The one where they open their eyes. Yeah, I've seen it. The one where they do this.

Hey, I haven't paid yet! Oh no! Haven't paid yet? We're having a bbq tonight.

Uh-huh, no problem. I'll keep you busy. These ideas are very interesting. Yoshio, just let me know anytime. I will add these dots. If you have any new ideas, you can tell me anytime.

Okay, no problem. If you need me again, just call me anytime. I'll sort out these records first. You can come to me again when you need me.

I can't hear you.

I don't know what's going on in my house. I only downloaded it a week later.

It's okay. This happens all the time. Take your time. If you need any help, just let me know.

You know I'm on it.

Okay, I understand. I will switch back to normal. If you need anything, just let me know. I wish you all the best.

Okay, I won't bother you anymore. Contact me anytime if you need anything. I wish you all the best.

No problem. I will wait for you here. You can call me anytime. I hope everything goes well for you.

Yes, yes. Let's see if it's enough to say it once. You still have to film now. You should be filming a game video.

We have to make the one for tomorrow. Yes, we have to make the one for tomorrow. Ok, you make the one for tomorrow, and we do the hangover. Can we do it this way?

That's it. Is that the idea? Or should we stop the brainstorming first? We can't do it all at once. I will ask LPL to sort out the ideas and group them into a few. Some of them can be used as features.

Okay, I'll ask her to write down the... the... what was it? Wait, what did I do wrong?

Let's sum up our discussion.

Hello? Do you want to watch the video? Yes, I want to watch.

Oh, she has CM's, and we're trying to make it work. I'll send you the link later. I'll try and...

I should look at your account. What account is this? I'll try to open it. I can see it, I can see it. If it's a video, it's this one, right? Oh, there's a video. I can see it, I can see it. Alright, let's dive into a topic that feels like it's pulled straight from science fiction, but is actually happening right now and could totally reshape our future.

We're talking about a technology that promises to solve problems our fastest supercomputers today wouldn't even know where to start with. So how on earth does it work? Let's get into it. To really get our heads around this, let's start with a fundamental question.

Think about it. For more than half a century, our entire digital world has been built on this simple binary language. Zeros and ones. Off and on. But what if a computer could play by a different set of rules? What if it could tap into the weird, probabilistic world of quantum mechanics, where things aren't so black and white? And that very question, it takes us right to the heart of what a quantum computer is.

It all starts by completely rethinking the most basic building block of computing, the bit that we've been using for decades. Okay, so this is where things get really different. A classical bit, the thing that powers every device you own, it's basically like a light switch. It's either off, that's a zero, or it's on, that's a one. Simple. But a quantum bit, or qubit for short, is way more like a spinning coin.

You know, while it's spinning in the air, it's not really heads or tails. It's kind of both at the same time. This both state is called a superposition. It's only when the coin lands, when we actually measure the qubit, that it decides to be a definite zero or a one. And that ability to exist in multiple states at once is where the mind-blowing power comes from.

What did you say? He said some YouTube channels are already using this method to upload videos. I saw it. It was released a month ago. I heard the internal version.

Two qubits can explore all four of those states simultaneously. So every single qubit you add literally doubles the computer's working space. That means a system with n qubits has a 2 to the power of n dimensional space to plan. A number that very quickly gets so ridiculously huge that no classical computer could ever hope to handle it. So how do qubits pull off this incredible feat? Well, they have what you could call a quantum toolkit. We're about to look at the two superpowers that quantum mechanics brings to the table for computing.

Superpower number one, as we just touched on, is superposition. That's the whole spinning coin idea. It lets a quantum computer chew on a massive number of possibilities all at the same time. Sometimes people call this quantum parallelism. It's not just doing one calculation after another. It's like exploring a giant landscape of potential answers all at once. Now, the second superpower is even weirder, if you can believe it. It's called entanglement. This is when two qubits get linked together in this special way where their fates are intertwined.

If you measure one of them and find out it's a zero, you instantly know the other one is a one, even if it's on the other side of the galaxy. It's this deep, almost spooky connection that allows for incredibly complex calculations that are just flat-out impossible in our normal, classical world.

And all this leads to a brilliant way of flipping the whole idea on its head, captured perfectly by the physicist Charlie Bennett. He suggests that maybe we've been asking the wrong question all along. Maybe quantum is the default setting for the universe.

So the real mystery isn't why quantum computers are so fast, but why our classical computers are so slow, held back by their rigid, one-thing-at-a-time rules. Okay, so we've got this incredible theoretical power, but what can you actually do with it? That brings us to the real-world impact, the whole why behind this quantum race, and the kind of impossible problems we could finally start to solve.

You know, the potential here wasn't always so obvious. It really took a series of major theoretical breakthroughs to show us what was possible. Back in 1985, Deutsch's algorithm was kind of the first proof of concept. But then, in 1994, Peter Shor sent absolute shockwaves through the cybersecurity world.

He showed that a quantum computer could, in theory, break most modern encryption. Two years after that, Grover's algorithm came along and showed a major speed-up for searching through huge, messy databases. And these algorithms, they unlocked some serious game-changers. I mean, forget just breaking today's internet security. Quantum computers could perfectly simulate molecules, which would be revolutionary for discovering new drugs and designing new materials.

They could solve insanely complex optimization problems for things like logistics or financial markets. They could even help us make things like fertilizer more efficiently. The process we use now, the Haber-Bosch process, uses up something like 2% of the entire world's energy supply every year.

Imagine making that better. Now all of that sounds absolutely amazing. So where are they? Why don't we have these incredible machines yet? Well, that takes us to the big reality check, the great quantum challenge. The single biggest enemy of quantum computing, the villain of this whole story, has a name. Decoherence. Remember that super delicate spinning coin state? Well, any tiny little thing from the outside world, a little bit of heat, a random vibration, even a stray cosmic ray, can knock it over and make it collapse before it's supposed to.

That messes everything up, introduces errors, and just destroys the whole quantum calculation. Cubits are unbelievably fragile. So just how fragile are we talking? This number right here, it tells the whole story. To stop that decoherence from happening, many quantum processors have to be kept at around 20 millikelvin.

With that in perspective, that is colder than an empty vacuum of deep space. Just building and maintaining an environment like that is a monumental engineering challenge all on its own. In fact, the physicist David Vincenzo basically laid out the five huge mountains you have to climb to build a useful quantum computer.

You don't just need qubits, you can scale up. You also have to be able to set them to a perfect starting state every single time. Then you need them to stay in that quantum state long enough to actually do a calculation using a standard set of operations.

And after all that, you have to be able to reliably read out the answer. The really hard part isn't just doing one of these things. It's doing all five, perfectly, at the same time, in the same machine. That is the grand challenge. And you know, there's some healthy skepticism out there.

Physicist Mikhail Dikanov points out that to describe a really useful quantum computer, you might need to control a number of variables as big as 10 to the power of 300. His take on whether we could ever really control a system that complex? A flat no, never.

It's an important perspective that helps ground all the hype in a bit of reality. So, given these massive challenges, you might wonder, where are we right now? Urgh. Wow. That's crazy. What's the state of a truly useful quantum machine? Welcome to what experts call the NISQ era. I know, it's computer science. In minutes, that would take the world's most powerful supercomputer, Summit, about 10,000 class meetings a year.

Can you, can you pause it?

A lot of people don't have to go that complicated.

It turns out that Firebase Studio is selling butter now.

The amount of gel will be crammed in the area though.

I don't know how to pronounce it. Wait, this is the process I just made.

Futter is included? I thought you were going to give up. No, I'm not. This is my first time using Futter. You need a web browser to play Futter.

I don't know if web and android can do it. Android can do it. iOS. Can iOS do it? I don't think so.

Oh, now I have to ask him a lot of questions. What are you doing?

I am still processing the discussion we just had. Let's pick three people to do it. We have three people. We have 9 project ideas, and he has grouped them into 4 submissions. The first one is AI Storyteller. I've been doing this for 4 years. You've worked hard. You've worked hard. Let's get the certificate. Yes.

The third one is Health Habits Visualization Tool. It teaches values and social meaning. The fourth one is Future Self Goal Visualization Tool.

... ... ... ...

Can you format this? I can't read.

A.I. Dream Machine Hold on, let me grab my phone I can't use it Can't use it

Let's take a look at it. The first one. From 0 to Manga.

AI one-piece script, multi-page comic, story, video, character story, pre-production, pre-cut character. This is pretty good. It helped us think of the script. Automatic voice-to-speech motion. OK. Create a new format for QL educators. Develop AI books, short stories, and AI cartoons. Wow, this is pretty good. CTA.

The basic module has been completed. Wow, that's pretty good. The first idea is to make an AI story machine. The second idea is a closet. This is from FaZePlay Studio. It is a self-portrait of an AI villager named X. It is a self-portrait of an AI villager named X.

I'm happy to hear you say that. He's happy. He's happy. Ah Sing is happy. Welcome to the US. Okay, it works. Okay, the second one is this. The third one is... This is a voice memo. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It's pretty local. Jewel Custom DSD.

Hello?

What kind of website are you searching for? I have memories in there.

You know, he will take your memories with him. He will take my memories with him. I am working on something now. He always takes my project contents with him. Of course, of course.

I think this topic is a bit hard to visualize.

Good, good. So what it does is it helps you... Because it sees what possibilities you have, you can choose the path you want to take, and it helps you break down what you have to do step by step. So that's another app. Oh shit, oh shit. So now we have four projects, right?

Alpha, you're done with this project, right? Not yet, I'm still filming. Filming? It's a poem. Why is it a poem?

We don't need an MVP or a tagger. We only need a punctuation. Even a punctuation and a webpage is enough. I want to share this with everyone so that we can continue after we watch it. Let's take a look at the screen. I've sent the link to the chat. Nano Banana is a super complete function.

What did I share? Your map. Oh, the link? It's your name, right? Oh, yes. There's also Goda. It's very nice. I don't know. It's something that can be done. The first core, the first chapter is to use the characters to be consistent with the topic we just talked about. Yes.

The second feature is Parcel Editing. You can change the color of the sofa. You can sit down with the sofa. Another one is style transfer or logical induction. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. What is synthetic ID? It's a watermark. Oh, a watermark. I know who made it. Google AdWords. Google AdWords.

This is how it can be done. There is another one. This is the application. He just mentioned one more thing that I forgot. Password editing is also something that can be done. The effect of password editing is to make a realistic change to the script.

It's the same as changing clothes. I can't say it in one sentence.

I haven't watched it yet. I will add it to my virtual corset when I change my hairstyle. 合成啦,你啱啱講同明星企喺隔離呢啲 celebrity 嗰啲啦,即係張呢個囉 I put Wong Yun-Fung next to it. Then there are post-production photos, super solutions, weather changes. These are things we wanted to do in the past but didn't do well.

For example, fast production of close-ups. Our video jams should use close-ups to mix with other things.

The animation follows the character. This is not a problem. The split screen is also interesting. Why is our flow so bad? Why is it not effective? Because we don't have a storyboard. If we have a storyboard in the flow, then we can... We will make a starting frame and an end frame for each trunk, so that it can consistently fill in the back end.

There is a Maya 3D editing tool at the back, and a mini version at the front. Lion is a magical creature. You can mix and match everything. For example, advertising. You don't need to do animation or effects when you go to the glacier. It's a new type of structure. This is just a prompt, how to write it better. It's called Gemini, but I made it. Did you send out the voice memo?

I think I sent it. Where did you send it? I sent it to my phone. I sent it to my phone. I sent it to my phone. Oh, I see it. Nice! Thank you, thank you. At least the contest has me brainstorming some ideas. Let's go.

It generates a lot of trajectory. If it can be generated, then history has generated it. It's very interesting. If we execute it at the end, we can generate it ourselves. The original is the best. But, let's talk about it later. I just shared my screen with Jimmy T. Can you see it?

Can you see it? Yes, I can.

This is the list of updates. The first one is the AI version. The AI version is more popular. The AI story mode. The comic book version. The second one is the future prediction simulator, which is a hot topic. The third one is the virtual closet. The fourth one is the visualization of health habits.

It's based on the Nanobanana's technical core and punctuation rules. We'll go with these three, right? What do you think? Yes. You will be in this room, right? Yes, I will be in this room. I will try to share the specs of this room with you to see if you are able to understand the conversation.

In case you need- Eh? It's not working again. Because it's a voice message. Copy the content. Why don't you use 4O? Eh? Why do I use 4O? Oh yeah, that's right. Where is this guy? I don't know who he is He has just been updated. He helped me choose an old model. I don't know why he is... Let me try it again

Try again. I told him to try again. Yes, a lot of people complained. I told him to try again. And then I... You are in thinking mode. He is not in thinking mode now. Oh, yes. It's fine. It's fine. Do I need to send you the specs? You can copy it to Notion. Or you can open a new chat and...

Let's see what it says. Let me see.

I can't share the screen. Okay. Inspiration. The first one is the Creator Courses. You can try this one. This is a new idea. Since WAPTO. Turn the green screen intermediary into a one-off environment. No. Cross-platform, consistent brand content. After a fixed IP.

The third one is Headshot Lab, 求職預期圖 This is also a very common use case. Voice-directed photo coach. I didn't expect there to be a voice input in this game. There is a part in the 11th level. Because there is a voice response in the 11th level. I have a video about it. If you use a real VIN, you won't have it. But the input online is the switch to TAS part.

It's for practical use. AB-Test is practical. It's very practical. Because they have to make a lot of product images. The images of different variants. It can also be used to connect to another GIMP. Is it Amazon? Google? No, it is shared with FAIL AI. FAIL AI is just a middle layer.

Who? Which company? Isn't it interesting? Oh, it's FAL, right? FAL is an API... OpenRouter's friend. OpenRouter's friend.

I asked him to bring some weird ideas. Basically, this is what everyone is doing right now. Even if Hackathon doesn't use it, Nanobanana is a good way to use it. Yes, we can also build this project. We can push it out after we build it. We need to put it on free IR. What? I can't hear you.

We tuned the foot AI Tuned the foot AI? Tuning Just kidding What tuning? Oh, pruning. Oh, pruning. No, no, no. Use it yourself. No. Because our biggest problem is to sort our own product. Yes, yes, yes. Unless the Nano Banana is sorting our own product. Unless we have A, B tests. It's useful. Yes.

It's useful, just like what I said before. Why is B to B easier than B to C? It's useful, it's okay.

Oh, this is quite interesting. This is very creative. The time-travelling suitcase... Oh, the time-travelling suitcase is the one I was talking about. I was talking about the time-travelling suitcase. The thing with the cat box. What is a voice memo?

I use voice to control it. You use voice to control it? Yes, just the interaction. Parallel career support is the same thing we just talked about. It's the same thing as the mouse control. It's the same thing as the mouse control. Multiplication. Multiplication. It's interesting. It's like playing with a toy. A silly toy. We need to find the simplest ones. Virtual content is too annoying. And too common.

Yes, you are right. We can see it with our own eyes. Actually, it's interesting to combine the two. Using VOC to jam the video. I don't like this one. You don't get it. You have a toy right now. I don't get it. You open it and it's the same toy. Recurrence, like recursive.

Anyway, when you see me now, I will hold it like this. Next step, you will see it. It's a recursive process. You see me now, I'm holding something in my hand. On the next screen, you will shift to the iPhone screen in my hand. It's a recursive process.

The concept is that you have a toy in your hand, and the toy in your hand is holding another toy, and the toy in your hand is holding another toy. Zoom in, yes. Then you have a video that keeps zooming in. You can use Lano Banana or UOP.

I don't really understand where the 8 is.

The problem is that people like to show off, or like you to talk. I've skipped some of these clips, have you seen them? I will skip it after 2 seconds. If our storytelling can be done in the 50s, 40s, 30s, 20s... I may not be able to save the content, but let's look at it again. The city, what if billboard. Put people on billboard. Billboard is also interesting.

For now, there is no one doing this. Maybe using the biggest billboard in Hong Kong and Taiwan to put you in. Or putting you in New York Times Square. It has also been videoed. I think it will be a big hit. But we can add a feature to it. Sure. Let's build a concept first. I think you don't have enough context to visualize it.

I'm starting to speak less clearly. You're too tired. It's 4pm. You've worked hard. No, I'm afraid I'm speaking less clearly.

You like to make JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley put their employees on stage. What is the purpose of consistency?

A similar concept is that there are a lot of billboards now. There are a lot of different people on the billboards. I will turn all the people on the billboards into you.

I understand, but... I don't think there's much to say. It seems like you've seen too much. I love, respect, locate. You've seen too much.

The reason why the cat exploded is because the landmark was added. But the cat is for a general object like Pokemon Go. The customization level has changed from general IP to personal level. It's like our model. It's always been a general model. It's just that I can't generate it like your model.

Emotions are very helpful.

What voice memo? I don't know.

Reboxing. Making your content variable. Emotions. Not making them up.

把生活物件重新合作,成為高級收藏。 例如咖啡杯還是焦爐,焦慮加速器人。 Mechanic Okay, say more. You said you are injured.

Let's take a look at the last two or three lines. 城市未縮 Street to... What does this mean? Dora... Doraemon? Eh... I don't know if that's right. No, it's not. A streetcar turned into a glass fence. Few people cross it.

Oh, so you're talking about the Shibuya Cross street? We will shrink it to make it look like a crystal ball. Oh, I see. So it's called a diorama.

See you, Rama.

We need to speed up, it's taking too long. Not a lot of time. Re-package ordinary objects into high-end retail products. For example, unboxing your YouTube channel.

把生活的物件選了,每件產品發揮功能反覆。 Coffee Cup 等於 Anxiety Acceleration V.1 Umbrella Decision Deferral Device Pong Charger So-so Deferred Sticky Notes IdeaCache

Procrastination.

Optimize your anxiety to output ratio.

It should be around 10 hours left. UTC plus 8 in HK. It's 4pm right now.

You guys are at 4pm. No, I'm at 4pm. You guys are... Oh, it's afternoon. You guys have to leave at 6am. 6am? Yes, 6am.

We will test our AI studio building. Yes, that's right.

You can run the demo, right? Do you need to ask him to upload the video? The video will be uploaded tomorrow.

How long did it take you to finish the demo?

How long does it take? One minute? One minute. Half a minute? Half a minute.

After you finish recording, you will start working on... Hegemon, right? Yes. Okay. Sorry Bill. Oh, sorry Bill. I'll get you a copy of the script. Let's see how to edit it better.
