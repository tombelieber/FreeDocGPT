# Enterprise Document Intelligence - Test Scenarios Plan

## Overview
Three critical test scenarios representing the most common tech enterprise documentation needs, designed to verify core RAG capabilities.

## Scenario 1: Technical Documentation & Code Knowledge Base
**Business Context**: Engineering teams need instant access to API docs, architecture decisions, and implementation guides.

### Test Documents
- **API Documentation** (5 Markdown files): REST endpoints, authentication, rate limits
- **Architecture Decision Records** (3-4 PDF files): System design choices, trade-offs
- **Code Implementation Guides** (3-4 HTML files): Best practices, code examples
- **Configuration Files** (2-3 JSON/YAML): Service configs, deployment specs

### Test Queries
1. "How do I authenticate with the payments API?"
2. "What database did we choose for the user service and why?"
3. "Show me the rate limit configuration for external APIs"
4. "What's the proper error handling pattern for microservices?"
5. "Find the deployment configuration for production environment"

### Success Criteria
- Accurate code snippet retrieval with formatting preserved
- Correct source attribution to specific documentation
- Response time < 3 seconds for technical queries
- Proper handling of JSON/YAML configuration queries

## Scenario 2: Product Requirements & Feature Specifications
**Business Context**: Product managers and developers need to track feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and design decisions across multiple products.

### Test Documents
- **PRD Documents** (5-6 PDFs with images/diagrams): Feature specs, user flows, mockups
- **Sprint Planning Notes** (4-5 Markdown files): User stories, acceptance criteria
- **Design Specifications** (3 Word docs): UI/UX requirements, interaction patterns
- **Data Requirements** (2 Excel files): Field definitions, validation rules

### Test Queries
1. "What are the acceptance criteria for the user authentication feature?"
2. "Show me the payment flow diagram from Q3 PRD"
3. "What data fields are required for customer onboarding?"
4. "Find all features planned for the mobile app v2.0"
5. "What were the non-functional requirements for search performance?"

### Success Criteria
- Accurate extraction from mixed-format documents (text + images)
- Proper interpretation of tables and structured data
- Ability to understand context across related documents
- Vision model correctly interprets diagrams when referenced

## Scenario 3: Meeting Notes & Decision Tracking
**Business Context**: Teams need to quickly find decisions, action items, and discussion outcomes from hundreds of meetings.

### Test Documents
- **Engineering Stand-ups** (10 Markdown files): Daily updates, blockers
- **Architecture Reviews** (5 PDFs): Technical decisions, risk assessments
- **Product Planning Meetings** (5 Word docs): Roadmap decisions, priorities
- **Incident Post-mortems** (3-4 Markdown): Root causes, action items

### Test Queries
1. "What action items came from last week's architecture review?"
2. "When did we decide to migrate to Kubernetes and who was responsible?"
3. "What were the root causes from the December outage?"
4. "Find all decisions about the payment gateway selection"
5. "What blockers were mentioned in this week's stand-ups?"

### Success Criteria
- Accurate extraction of action items and decisions
- Proper date/time context understanding
- Ability to aggregate information across multiple meetings
- Clear attribution to specific meeting notes

## Benchmarking Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Indexing Speed**: 50+ documents in < 2 minutes
- **Query Response**: First token < 1 second, complete response < 5 seconds
- **Token Generation**: > 20 tokens/second
- **Search Accuracy**: 90%+ relevance for top-3 results

### Quality Metrics
- **Answer Accuracy**: Verified against known correct answers
- **Source Attribution**: 100% accurate document citations
- **Format Preservation**: Code blocks, tables, lists properly formatted
- **Language Handling**: Correct processing of mixed English/Chinese docs

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Document Preparation (Day 1)
1. Gather/create representative documents for each scenario
2. Include edge cases: large files (>100 pages), mixed languages, complex tables
3. Organize in folder structure: `/test_scenarios/scenario_1/`, etc.

### Phase 2: Indexing Tests (Day 2)
1. Test auto-detection accuracy for document types
2. Verify chunking strategies for different content
3. Measure indexing performance with concurrent processing
4. Test incremental indexing (no duplicates)

### Phase 3: Query Testing (Day 3-4)
1. Execute all test queries per scenario
2. Verify answer accuracy and completeness
3. Check source attribution correctness
4. Measure response times and token generation rates

### Phase 4: Stress Testing (Day 5)
1. Load 500+ documents across all types
2. Execute 50 queries in rapid succession
3. Test with complex multi-part questions
4. Verify system stability and performance degradation

## Expected Outcomes

### Must Pass
- All three scenarios achieve 85%+ query accuracy
- Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
- No data loss or corruption during indexing
- Proper error handling for unsupported formats

### Nice to Have
- Cross-document relationship understanding
- Temporal awareness (understanding "last week", "Q3", etc.)
- Multi-hop reasoning across documents
- Automatic summarization of long documents

## Risk Mitigation
- **Large PDFs with images**: Test with 100+ page technical specs
- **Mixed languages**: Include Chinese technical terms in English docs
- **Code-heavy content**: Ensure proper formatting of code snippets
- **Concurrent usage**: Simulate multiple users querying simultaneously
